# Connect 4 Game

One of my first ever creations, a classic Connect 4 game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing players to compete against each other or challenge a basic AI.

## Features

* **Two-Player Mode:** Play against a friend on the same board.

* **Player vs. CPU Mode:** Challenge a simple AI opponent.

* **Win Condition Detection:** Automatically detects horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.

* **Tie Game Detection:** Identifies when the board is full and no winner is found.

* **Game Reset:** Easily restart the game at any time.

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for a better playing experience on various devices.

## üöÄ How to Play

1.  **Objective:** Be the first player to get four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

2.  **Dropping Discs:** Click on any column to drop your disc into the lowest available slot in that column.

3.  **Player Turns:** Players take turns dropping discs. Red goes first.

4.  **CPU Mode:**

    * Click the "Play against CPU" button to toggle CPU mode on/off.

    * When CPU mode is active, the computer (Yellow player) will make a random valid move after the human player's turn.

5.  **Reset Game:** Click the "Reset Game" button to clear the board and start a new game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the game structure and layout.

* **CSS3:** For styling the game board, discs, and responsive design.

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For game logic, player turns, win/tie detection, and CPU AI.
